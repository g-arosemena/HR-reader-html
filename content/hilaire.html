Court of Human Rights, Case of Hilaire, Constantine and Benjamin et
al. v. Trinidad and Tobago</h1>
<p>Judgment of June 21, 2002 (Merits, Reparations and Costs)</p>
<h2 id="facts">Facts</h2>
<ol start="84" type="1">
<li>The Court now proceeds to consider the relevant facts that it deems
to be proven and which result from the analysis of the proceedings, as
well as the documentary evidence (which highlights the domestic
legislation of Trinidad and Tobago) and expert testimonial evidence
provided.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>All the alleged victims were tried and convicted of murder in
Trinidad and Tobago, and sentenced to death pursuant to the Offences
Against the Person Act in force in the State since April 3,
1925.89</p></li>
<li><p>The Offences Against the Person Act prescribes the death penalty
as the only applicable sentence for the crime of murder. 90</p></li>
<li><p>Section 3 of the Offences Against the Person Act adopts the
English common law definition of murder, which in turn provides that a
defendant may be convicted of murder if it is established that he
unlawfully caused the death of another person with the intention to kill
or to cause serious bodily injury.91</p></li>
<li><p>The Offences Against the Person Act permits the jury to consider
certain determinative circumstances of the killing for the purpose of
establishing whether the accused should be found guilty of murder or of
a lesser crime.92</p></li>
<li><p>Once an offender is found guilty of murder, the Offences Against
the Person Act does not permit the judge or jury to consider the
particular circumstances of the offence or offender for the purpose of
determining the appropriate penalty.93</p></li>
<li><p>Article 6 of the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and
Tobago precludes individuals from challenging, under Sections 4 and 5 of
the Constitution, all laws or acts carried out pursuant to any law in
force in Trinidad and Tobago before 1976, the year the Constitution
entered into force.94</p></li>
<li><p>The 32 persons comprised in this case all invoked the appropriate
domestic recourses for the review of their convictions (supra para.
60).</p></li>
<li><p>In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad
and Tobago, the President of the Republic retains a discretionary power
to pardon those sentenced to death.95</p></li>
<li><p>The Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago provides
for an Advisory Committee on the Power of Pardon, which is charged with
considering and making recommendations to the relevant Minister as to
whether an offender sentenced to death should benefit from discretionary
pardon.96</p></li>

VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 4(1) and 4(2), IN RELATION TO ARTICLES 1(1)</h2>
<p>AND 2 OF THE AMERCIAN CONVENTION. (Mandatory Death Penalty)</p>
<ol start="88" type="1">
<li><p>The Commission added that the use of the “mandatory death
penalty” by Trinidad and Tobago results in its imposition on all persons
convicted of murder, without taking into account the mitigating and
aggravating circumstances of the case or the varying degrees of
culpability. In the Commission’s opinion, the foregoing contravenes the
inherent dignity of the human being and the right to humane treatment
protected in Article 5(1) and 5(2) of the American Convention.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commission added that the “mandatory imposition of the death
penalty,” that is, where the death penalty is the only imposable
punishment for murder cases, eliminates the possibility of determining
individualised sentences and prevents a rational and proportional
relation between the offender, the crime and the punishment imposed and
does not allow judicial review of the judgment, according to the terms
of the American Convention.</p></li>
<li><p>In light of the general spirit evident in Article 4 of the
American Convention, considered in its entirety, the Court has found
that:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[t]hree types of limitations can be seen to be applicable to States
Parties which have not abolished the death penalty. First, the
imposition or application of this sanction is subject to certain
procedural requirements whose compliance must be strictly observed and
reviewed. Second, the application of the death penalty must be limited
to the most serious common crimes not related to political offenses.
Finally, certain considerations involving the person of the defendant,
which may bar the imposition or application of the death penalty, must
be taken into account.108 101) The Court is aware of the pain and
suffering inflicted upon the direct victims and their next of kin by the
perpetrators in murder cases, and is cognizant of the State’s duty to
protect potential victims of this crime, punish those responsible and
generally maintain public order, which may be affected by the
proliferation of these types of crimes. The Court also considers that
the State’s struggle against murder should be carried out with the
utmost respect for the human rights of the persons under their
jurisdiction and in compliance with the applicable human rights
treaties.109</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="102" type="1">
<li><p>The intentional and illicit deprivation of another’s life
(intentional or premeditated murder, in the broad sense) can and must be
recognised and addressed in criminal law under various categories
(criminal classes) that correspond with the wide range of gravity of the
surrounding facts, taking into account the different facets that can
come into play: a special relationship between the offender and the
victim, motives for the behaviour, the circumstances under which the
crime is committed, the means employed by the offender, etc. This
approach allows for a graduated assessment of the gravity of the
offence, so that it will bear an appropriate relation to the graduated
levels of gravity of the applicable punishment.</p></li>
<li><p>The Court finds that the Offences Against the Person Act of 1925
of Trinidad and Tobago automatically and generically mandates the
application of the death penalty for murder and disregards the fact that
murder may have varying degrees of seriousness. Consequently, this Act
prevents the judge from considering the basic circumstances in
establishing the degree of culpability and individualising the sentence
since it compels the indiscriminate imposition of the same punishment
for conduct that can be vastly different. In light of Article 4 of the
American Convention, this is exceptionally grave, as it puts at risk the
most cherished possession, namely, human life, and is arbitrary
according to the terms of Article 4(1) of the Convention.110</p></li>
<li><p>The Court finds that the Offences Against the Person Act has two
principal aspects: a) in the determination of criminal responsibility,
it only authorizes the competent judicial authority to find a person
guilty of murder solely based on the categorization of the crime,
without taking into account the personal conditions of the defendant or
the individual circumstances of the crime; and b) in the determination
of punishment, it mechanically and generically imposes the death penalty
for all persons found guilty of murder and prevents the modification of
the punishment through a process of judicial review.</p></li>
<li><p>The Court concurs with the view that to consider all persons
responsible for murder as deserving of the death penalty, “treats all
persons convicted of a designated offense not as uniquely individual
human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be
subjected to the blind infliction of the death penalty.”111</p></li>
<li><p>In countries where the death penalty still exists, one of the
ways in which the deprivation of life can be arbitrary under Article
4(1) of the Convention is when it is used, as is the case in Trinidad
and Tobago due to the Offences Against the Person Act, to punish crimes
that do not exhibit characteristics of utmost seriousness, in other
words, when the application of this punishment is contrary to the
provisions of Article 4(2) of the American Convention.</p></li>
<li><p>In light of these facts, the Court concludes that because the
Offences Against the Person Act submits all persons charged with murder
to a judicial process in which the individual circumstances of the
accused and the crime are not considered, the aforementioned Act
violates the prohibition against the arbitrary deprivation of life, in
contravention of Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the Convention.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, the Court considers that Trinidad and Tobago has
violated Article 4(1) and 4(2) in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the
Convention, to the detriment of Haniff Hilaire, George Constantine,
Wenceslaus James, Denny Baptiste, Clarence Charles, Keiron Thomas,
Anthony Garcia, Wilson Prince, Darrin Roger Thomas, Mervyn Edmund,
Samuel Winchester, Martin Reid, Rodney Davis, Gangadeen Tahaloo, Noel
Seepersad, Wayne Matthews, Alfred Frederick, Natasha De Leon, Vijay
Mungroo, Phillip Chotalal, Naresh Boodram, Joey Ramiah, Nigel Mark,
Wilberforce Bernard, Steve Mungroo, Peter Benjamin, Krishendath
Seepersad, Allan Phillip, Narine Sooklal, Amir Mowlah, Mervyn Parris and
Francis Mansingh.</p></li>
