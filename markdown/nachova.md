(Applications nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98)

26 February 2004

Summary

## The Facts

9.  In 1996 Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov, who were both twenty-one years old, were conscripts in the Construction Force (Строителни войски), a division of the army dealing with the construction of apartment blocks and other civilian projects.

10.  Early in 1996 Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were arrested for repeated absences without leave. On 22 May 1996 Mr Angelov was sentenced to nine-months' imprisonment and Mr Petkov to five-month imprisonment. Both had previous convictions for theft.

11.  On 15 July 1996 they escaped from a construction site outside the prison where they had been brought for work and went to the home of Mr Angelov's grandmother, Ms Tonkova, in the village of Lesura. Neither man was armed.

12.  Their absence was reported the following day and their names put on the military police's wanted list. A warrant for their arrest was received on 16 July 1996 by the Vratsa Military-Police Unit.

13.  At around twelve noon on 19 July 1996 the officer on duty in the Vratsa Military-Police Unit received an anonymous telephone message that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were hiding in the village of Lesura. On at least one of the previous occasions when he had been absent without leave, it was there that Mr Angelov had been found and arrested.

14.  The commanding officer, Colonel D., decided to dispatch four military police officers, under the command of Major G., to locate and arrest the two men. At least two of the officers knew one or both of them. Major G. apparently knew Lesura since, according to a secretary who worked at the municipality and was heard later as a witness, his mother was from the village.

15.  Colonel D. told the officers that “in accordance with the rules” they should carry their handguns and automatic rifles and wear bullet-proof vests. He informed them that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were “criminally active” (криминално проявени) – a euphemism used to denote persons with previous convictions or persons suspected of offence – and that they had escaped from detention. The officers were instructed that all means and methods dictated by the circumstances were to be used to arrest them.

16.  The officers immediately left for Lesura in a jeep. Two officers wore uniforms while the others were in civilian clothes. Only Major G. wore a bullet-proof vest. He was armed with a personal handgun and a 7.62 mm. calibre Kalashnikov automatic rifle. The other men carried handguns. Three Kalashnikov automatic rifles remained in the boot of the vehicle throughout the operation.

17.  The officers were briefed orally by Major G. on their way to Lesura. Sergeant N. was to cover the east side of the house, Major G. the west side and Sergeant K. was to go into the house. Sergeant S., the driver, was to remain with the vehicle and keep watch over the north side.

18.  At around 1 p.m. the officers arrived in Lesura. They asked a secretary at the town hall and one of the villagers, Mr T. M., to join them and show them Mr Angelov's grandmother's house. The vehicle drove into Lesura's Roma district.

19.  Sergeant N. recognised the house since he had previously arrested Mr Angelov there for being absent without leave.

20.  As soon as the jeep drew up in front of the house at between 1 p.m. and 1.30 p.m., Sergeant K. recognised Mr Angelov, who was inside, behind the window. Having noticed the vehicle, the fugitives tried to escape. The police officers heard the sound of a window-pane being broken. Major G. and Sergeants K. and N. jumped out of the vehicle while it was still moving. Major G. and Sergeant K. went through the garden gate, the former going to the west side of the house, and the latter entering the house. Sergeant N. headed to the east side of the house. Sergeant S. remained with the car, together with the secretary who worked at the town hall and Mr T. M.

21.  Sergeant N. later testified that, having noticed Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov escaping through the window and running towards a neighbour's yard, he had shouted: “Stop, military police!”. He had pulled out his gun, but not fired any shots. The two men had carried on running. Sergeant N. had run out on to the street in an effort to intercept them by circumventing several houses. While running, he had heard Major G. shout: “Freeze, military police, freeze [or] I'll shoot!”. It was then that the shooting had started.

22.  Major G. stated in his testimony:

> “...I heard Sergeant N. shouting: 'Freeze, police'...I saw the privates; they were running and then stopped in front of the fence between Ms Tonkova's and the neighbour's yards... I saw that they were trying to jump over the [chain-link] fence, so I shouted: 'Freeze, or I'll shoot'. I released the safety-catch and loaded the automatic gun. Then I fired a shot in the air, holding the automatic rifle upwards with my right hand, almost perpendicular to the ground... The privates climbed over the [chain-link] fence and continued to run, I followed them, then I fired one, two or three more times in the air and shouted: 'Freeze!', but they continued running. I again fired shots in the air with the automatic and shouted: 'Freeze, or I will shoot with live cartridges”, I warned them again, but they continued running without turning back. I fired to the right [of the two men] with the automatic after the warning, aiming at the ground, hoping that this would make them stop running. I again shouted “Freeze!” when they were at the corner of the other house and then I aimed and fired at them as they were scaling the fence. I aimed at their feet. The ground where I stood was at a lower level... [B]y jumping over the second fence they would have escaped and I did not have any other means of stopping them. The gradient there was a bit steep, [I] was standing on lower ground ... the second fence was on the highest ground, that is why when I fired the first time I aimed to the side [of the two men], as I considered that nobody from the neighbouring houses would be hurt, and the second time I aimed at the privates, but fired at their feet. Under Regulation 45 we can use firearms to arrest members of the military forces who have committed a publicly prosecuted offence and do not surrender after a warning, but in accordance with paragraph 3 of [that regulation] we have to protect the lives of the persons against whom [we use firearms] – for that reason I fired at [the victims'] feet – with the intention of avoiding fatal injury. The last time that I shot at the privates' feet, I was 20 metres away from them and they were exactly at the south-east corner of the neighbouring yard. After the shooting they both fell down...They were both lying on their stomachs, and both gave signs of life, ... moaning ... then Sergeant S. appeared, I called him ... and handed him my automatic rifle...”

23.  According to the statements of the three subordinate officers, Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were lying on the ground in front of the fence, with their legs pointing to the direction of the house from which they had come. One of them was lying on his back and the other on his stomach.

24.  A neighbour, Mr Z., who lived opposite Mr Angelov's grandmother, also gave evidence. At about 1.00 or 1.30 p.m. he had seen a military jeep pull up in front of Ms Tonkova's house. Then he had heard somebody shout: “Don't run, I am using live cartridges”. He had then heard shots. He had looked into the next yard and seen Mr Angelov, whom he knew, and another man leap over the chain-link fence between Ms Tonkova's and another neighbour's yards. He had not seen the man who had been shouting as he was behind Ms Tonkova's house. Then he had seen Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov fall to the ground and the man who had shot them emerge, holding an automatic rifle. Mr Z. further stated:

> “The other men in uniform then started remonstrating with [the man who had shot Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov] telling him that he should not have fired, that he should not have come with them. Of those who came in the jeep, only the senior officer fired ... I know him by sight, he has relatives in Lesura”.

25.  Sergeant S. stated that upon arriving at the house he had remained with the vehicle and had heard Sergeant N. shouting from the east side of the house: “Freeze, police!”. He had also heard Major G. shout several times: “Freeze, police!”, from the west side of the house. Then Major G. had started shooting with his automatic weapon, while continuing to shout. Sergeant S. had then entered the yard. He had seen Major G. leap over the chain-link fence and heard him shouting. He had gone up to him, had taken his automatic rifle and seen Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov lying on the ground next to the fence. They were still alive. At that moment Sergeant K. had come out of the house. Major G. had gone to get the jeep and had reported the event over the vehicle radio. When they returned, Sergeant N. had appeared from the neighbouring street and helped them put the wounded men in the vehicle.

26.  The head of the Vratsa Military-Police Unit and other officers were informed about the incident at around 1.30 p.m.

27.  Sergeant K. testified that he had entered the house and had been speaking to Mr Angelov's grandmother and another woman when he heard Major G. shouting at Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov to halt. In the house, he had noticed that a window-pane in the room overlooking the yard had been broken. He had been on the verge of leaving the house when he heard shooting coming from behind the house. On his way to the yard he had met Major G., who had told him that the fugitives had been wounded. Sergeant K. had then climbed over the chain-link fence and approached the wounded men, who were still alive and moaning. He had found himself holding the automatic rifle, but could not remember how it had come into his possession. He had opened the magazine and seen no cartridges in it. There was only one cartridge left in the barrel.

28.  Immediately after the shooting, a number of people from the vicinity gathered. Sergeant K. and Sergeant S. took the wounded men to the Vratsa Hospital, while Major G. and Sergeant N. remained at the scene.

29.  Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov died on the way to Vratsa. They were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.

30.  Mr Angelov's grandmother, Ms Tonkova, gave the following version of the events: Her grandson and Mr Petkov had been in her house when they had noticed a jeep approaching. She had gone outside and seen four men in uniform. They had all entered the yard, one of them had gone round the house and started shooting with an automatic rifle for a very long time. The other three men were also armed but had not fired any shots. She had been in the yard, pleading with the man who had been shooting to stop. However, he had walked towards the back of the house. Then she had heard shooting in the backyard. She had followed and then seen her grandson and Mr Petkov lying in the neighbours' yard with bullet wounds.

31.  According to another neighbour, Mr M.M., all three policemen were shooting. Two of them had fired shots in the air and the third officer – who had been on the west side of the house (Major G.) – had been aiming at someone. Mr M.M. had heard some fifteen to twenty shots, perhaps more. Then he had seen the military policemen go to the neighbouring yard, where Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had fallen. That yard belonged to Mr M.M. and his daughter. On seeing his grandson – a young boy – standing there, Mr M.M. had asked Major G. for permission to approach and collect him. Major G. had pointed his gun at him in a brutal manner and had insulted him, saying: “You damn Gypsies!”.

32.  On 19 July 1996 all the officers involved made separate reports in connection with the deaths to the Vratsa Military-Police Unit. None of them was tested for alcohol.

33.  A criminal investigation into the deaths was opened the same day and between 4 p.m. and 4.30 p.m. a military investigator inspected the scene. In his report he described the scene, including the respective positions of Ms Tonkova's house, the first chain-link fence, and the spent cartridges and bloodstains found there. He indicated that the structure of the first chain-link fence was damaged and the fence had been torn down in one place.

34.  A sketch map was appended to the report. It showed the yard of Ms Tonkova's house and the neighbouring yard where Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had fallen. The places where spent cartridges had been found were indicated. The sketch-map and the report gave only some of the measurements of the yards. The gradient and other characteristics of the terrain and the surrounding area were not described.

35.  Nine spent cartridge were retrieved. One cartridge was found in the street, in front of Ms Tonkova's house (apparently not far from where the jeep had stopped). Four cartridges were discovered in Ms Tonkova's yard, behind the house, close to the first chain-link fence separating her yard from the neighbour's yard. Three cartridges were found in the neighbour's (Mr M.M.'s) yard, close to the place where the bloodstains were found. Although the exact distance between those cartridges and the bloodstains was not given, it appears from the other measurements on the sketch map to be between 5 and 10 metres. A ninth cartridge was found subsequently and handed in to the military police by Mr Angelov's uncle. There is no record of where it was found.

36.  The bloodstains were a metre apart. They were marked on the sketch map as being slightly more than nine metres from the first chain-link fence. The distance between the bloodstains and the second fence that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were apparently trying to scale when they were shot was not indicated. Samples of the bloodstains were taken by the investigator.

37.  On 21 July 1996, a pathologist carried out an autopsy.

According to the autopsy report no. 139/96, the cause of Mr Petkov's death was “a wound to the chest”, the direction of the shot having been “from front to back”. The wound was described as follows:

> “There is an oval-shaped wound of 2.5 cm by 1 cm in the chest, at a distance of 144 cm from the feet, with missing tissues, and jagged and compressed edges in the area of the left shoulder. There is an oval-shaped wound of 3 cm in the back, to the left of the infrascapular line at a distance of 123 cm from the feet with missing tissues, jagged and torn edges turned outwards.”

38.  As regards Mr Angelov, the report found that the cause of death had been “a gunshot wound, which [had] damaged a major blood vessel” and that the direction of the shot had been “from back to front”. It was further stated:

> “There is a round wound on the left of the buttocks at a distance of 90 cm from the feet... with missing tissue, jagged walls and edges, and a diameter of about 0.8 cm ... There is an oval wound of 2.1 cm with jagged torn edges and walls turned outwards and missing tissues on the border between the lower and middle third [of the abdomen], at a distance of 95 cm from the feet, slightly to the left of the navel.”

39.  The report concluded that the injuries had been caused by an automatic rifle fired from a distance.

## IV.  RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW

A.  United Nations principles

67.  The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (“UN Force and Firearms Principles”) were adopted on 7 September 1990 by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders.

68.  Paragraph 9 provides:

“Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.”

69.  According to other provisions of the Principles, law enforcement officials shall “act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved” (paragraph 5). Also, “Governments shall ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence under their law” (paragraph 7). National rules and regulations on the use of firearms should “ensure that firearms are used only in appropriate circumstances and in a manner likely to decrease the risk of unnecessary harm”.

## The Law

96.  It is undisputed that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had committed offences and were shot and fatally wounded in an operation to effect their lawful arrest.

97.  It follows that the complaints must be examined under Article 2 § 2 (b) of the Convention.

(i)  Surrounding circumstances

98.  Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov, who were serving sentences for being absent without leave from compulsory military service, had escaped from detention. Both had served in the Construction Force, a special army institution in which conscripts discharged their duties as construction workers on non-military sites.

99.  Furthermore, Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were serving short sentences for non-violent offences. They had escaped without using violence, simply by leaving their place of work, which was outside the detention facility. Neither man was armed or represented a danger to the arresting officers or third parties. While they had previous convictions for theft and had repeatedly been absent without leave, they had no record of violence (see paragraphs 9‑11 above).

100.  It follows that their escape did not entail any particular risk of irreversible harm.

101.  Further, the behaviour of Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov must have appeared to the authorities as predictable, since, following a previous escape Mr Angelov had been found at the same address in Lesura (see paragraphs 13 and 19 above).

(ii)  The actions of the arresting officers

102.  The evidence shows that the arresting officers were fully aware that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were not armed or dangerous. Firstly, the officers knew that they were detainees and conscripts in the Construction Force who had escaped from their place of work. Furthermore, at least two of the officers knew one or both of the men from a previous arrest. Nothing in the information available to the officers could reasonably make them fear violence on the part of Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov. In any event, on encountering the men in the village of Lesura, the officers, or at least Major G., observed that they were unarmed and not showing any signs of threatening behaviour (see paragraphs 9‑14 and 19‑27 above). However, Major G. disregarded the above circumstances and, in an attempt to prevent their escape, fired at them, fatally wounding them.

103.  The Court considers that, balanced against the imperative need to preserve life as a fundamental value, the legitimate aim of effecting a lawful arrest cannot justify putting human life at risk where the fugitive has committed a non-violent offence and does not pose a threat to anyone. Any other approach would be incompatible with the basic principles of democratic societies, as universally accepted today (see the relevant provisions of the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials in paragraphs 67‑70 above and, mutatis mutandis, the Court's reasoning in Öcalan v. Turkey, no. 46221/99, § 196, 12 March 2003).

104.  It is only in subparagraphs (a) and (c) of Article 2 § 2 that violence (in the form of unlawful violence, a riot or an insurrection) is expressly made a condition that will justify the use of potentially lethal force. However, the principle of strict proportionality as enshrined in Article 2 of the Convention cannot be read in dissociation from the purpose of that provision: the protection of the right to life. This implies that a similar condition applies to cases under subparagraph (b).

105.  The use of potentially lethal firearms inevitably exposes human life to danger even when there are rules designed to minimise the risks. Accordingly, the Court considers that it can in no circumstances be “absolutely necessary” within the meaning of Article 2 § 2 of the Convention to use such firearms to arrest a person suspected of a non-violent offence who is known not to pose a threat to life or limb, even where a failure to do so may result in the opportunity to arrest the fugitive being lost (see the following cases in which the use of firearms was found to have been justified – all of them concerned situations where the State agents involved acted in the belief that there was a threat of violence or in order to apprehend fugitives suspected of violent offences: W. v. Germany, no. 11257/84, Commission decision of 6 October 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 49, p. 213; Kelly v. the United Kingdom, no. 17579/90, Commission decision of 13 January 1993, DR 74, p. 139; M.D. v. Turkey, no. 28518/95, Commission decision of 30 June 1997, unreported, Laginha de Matos v. Portugal, no. 28955/95, Commission decision of 7 April 1997, DR 89, p. 98; Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above and Caraher v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24520/94, ECHR 2000‑I; see also the Court's approach in McCann and Others, cited above, pp. 45‑46, §§ 146‑50 and pp. 56‑62, §§ 192‑214; see also the Court's condemnation of the use of firearms against unarmed and non-violent persons trying to leave the former German Democratic Republic in Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, §§ 87, 96 and 97, ECHR 2001-II).

106.  It follows that in the circumstances that obtained in the present case (see paragraphs 98‑100 above) the use of firearms could not possibly have been “absolutely necessary” and was prohibited by Article 2 of the Convention.

107.  Furthermore, the Court finds that unnecessarily excessive force was used in the present case. In particular:

(i)  Major G. decided to open fire at a moment when another officer was trying to head the fugitives off and other options for effecting the arrest were open: some of the officers knew the village of Lesura, Mr Angelov had already been arrested there on a previous occasion, he was known to some of the officers, the officers had a jeep and the operation took place in a small village in the middle of the day;

(ii)  Major G. was also carrying a handgun but chose to use his automatic rifle and switched it to automatic mode. His assertion that he took care to aim at the victims' feet is incompatible with the manner in which he fired: he could not possibly have aimed with any reasonable degree of precision using automatic fire (see paragraphs 13, 14, 16 and 18‑24 above);

(iii)  Since spent cartridges were found in Mr M.M.'s yard, only a few metres from the spot where Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov fell, it is unlikely that Major G. fired from a distance of about 20 metres, as he claimed (see paragraphs 22 and 35 above);

(iv)  Mr Petkov was wounded in the chest, which may suggest that he had turned to surrender at the last minute (see paragraph 37 above). The Government's explanation was that Mr Petkov must have been in the process of jumping over the fence and had therefore turned to face Major G. for a moment (see paragraph 86 above). That suggestion, which was not investigated but was formulated for the first time in the proceedings before the Court, appears implausible given that after the shooting both victims fell in front of the fence they had allegedly been trying to scale and not on the other side. The Government's allegation that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had acted recklessly as they were probably drunk is groundless, since the alcohol content found in their blood was very low (see paragraphs 23, 42 and 46‑50 above).

108.  On the basis of the above, the applicants alleged that there had been an intention to kill on the part of Major G. They also claimed that prejudice against Roma had been a decisive factor in the deaths of Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov and made detailed submissions in that respect, relying on Article 14 of the Convention (see paragraphs 153‑155 below).

115.  The Court thus finds that respondent State is responsible for deprivation of life in violation of Article 2 of the Convention, as firearms were used to arrest persons who were suspected of non-violent offences, were not armed and did not pose any threat to the arresting officers or others. The violation of Article 2 is further aggravated by the fact that excessive firepower was used. The respondent State is also responsible for the failure to plan and control the operation for the arrest of Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov in a manner compatible with Article 2 of the Convention.
